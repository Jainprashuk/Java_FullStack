// Types Of Languages (Procedural , Functional , Object Oriented)
1. Procedural
   - Well structured steps and procedures
   - systematic order of statements , functions and cammoands to compleate a task
2. Functional
   - writing a program in pure functions
3. Object-Oriented
   - resolves around objects

C++  -  Object-Oriented, Procedural, Generic Programming
Java  -  Object-Oriented, Procedural
Python -	Object-Oriented, Procedural, Functional
JavaScript - Object-Oriented, Procedural, Functional
C - Procedural


--> First-class functions are a feature in programming languages where functions are treated as "first-class citizens." This means functions can be passed around and used just like any other value (such as numbers, strings, or objects).
--> complile time - Compile time refers to the period during which a program's source code is converted into executable machine code by a compiler. In other words, it is the phase when the source code is checked for syntax errors, type errors, and various optimizations are performed by the compiler
--> Runtime - it refers to the period when a program is actively executing after it has been compiled


// Types Of Languages (Static and Dynamic)
1. Static
   - perform type checking at compile time
   - Error will be shown at compile time
   - decare type of variable
   - c , cpp , java
2. Dynamic
   - perform type checking at runtime
   - Error will be shown at runtime
   - No need to declare type of variable
   - python , javascript
